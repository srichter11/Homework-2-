Simple app with login, age verification, etc

For the login screen, I first converted the age input into an integer so that it could be read in comparison to other numbers.
Then i used a series of conditional functions to set up the response to a user's input. Within this, i used string interpolation. 

For the addition screen, i also made the input equal an integer and then i made sure to store the existing number
in the next view field so that it could be added to. 

For the even/odd screen, i did somilar as above but used the remainder function to identify whether a number was even
or odd.
